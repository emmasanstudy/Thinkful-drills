    "Now it's time for another guided example. This time we're going to look at recipes. Specifically we'll use the epicurious dataset, which has a collection of recipes, key terms and ingredients, and their ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to see is if we can use the ingredient and keyword list to predict the rating. For someone writing a cookbook this could be really useful information that could help them choose which recipes to include because they're more likely to be enjoyed and therefore make the book more likely to be successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's load the dataset. It's [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes). We'll use the csv file here and as pull out column names and some summary statistics for ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly the overfit is a problem, even though it was poor in the first place. We could go back and clean up our feature set. There might be some gains to be made by getting rid of the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also see how removing the nulls but including dietary information performs. Though its a slight change to the question we could still possibly get some improvements there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we could take our regression problem and turn it into a classifier. With this number of features and a discontinuous outcome, we might have better luck thinking of this as a classification problem. We could make it simpler still by instead of classifying on each possible value, group reviews to some decided high and low values.\n",
