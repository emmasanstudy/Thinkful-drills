    "For the variance, I would choose standard deviation, because it is more meaningful than variance statistically speaking. Based on the distribution of the data, it can give us a better idea of the variation. The reason that I didn't choose standard error was that in this particular case, we don't really care how well this sample represents the population.\n",
